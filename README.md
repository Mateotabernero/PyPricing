# PyPricing
PyPricing is an Option Pricing library written in Python. The library includes:

-  Pricing of European and American Option and computation of greeks: Binomial, MonteCarlo and Black-Scholes
-  Stock price models (GBM, Heston) and different SDE integrating methods (Euler-Maruyama, Milstein)
-  Pricing of exotic options (Asian, Digital)
-  Advanced techniques: FFT, COS transforms (Currently working on this) 

The library is currently divided in three folders: 

- The MC folder, including option pricing based on Monte Carlo methods
- The BinOP folder, including option pricing based on the Binomial model
- The BlackScholes folder, with option pricing based on the Black-Scholes model 

## MC folder 
This folder is dedicated to Monte Carlo methods for option pricing and consists of five folders: 
- GBM.py contains functions for generating random paths and pricing options under Geometric Brownian Motion 
- heston.py contains functions for generating random paths and pricing options under Heston model
- payOffs.py is dedicated to computing payOffs of random paths generated by the above files
- main.py provides an OOP approach to MC option pricing
- examples.py includes examples of the usage of the functions on this folder 

### GBM file 
The Geometric Brownian Motion consider stock prices ($S_t$) move according to the following SDE: 

$$ dS_t = r S_t dt + \sigma S_t  dW_t $$

Where $W_t$ is a Wiener process

The main function of this file is the GBM function, which generates random paths of stock prices numerically integrating the GBM using different methods (Euler-Maruyama, Milstein and Runge-Kutta). Variance reduction methods are also available (Antithetic variates) 
Then, eu_GBM and as_GBM use the paths generated by the GBM function to price European and Asian options using MC method

### Heston file 
This file is similar to the GBM.py file, but uses the Heston model, in which stock prices move according to the SDE: 

$$ dS_t = r S_t dt + \sqrt{\nu_t } S_t dW_t^S $$

Where $\nu_t$, the instantaneous variance, is given by the following CIR process: 

$$ d\nu_t  = \kappa (\theta - \nu_t) dt + \xi \sqrt{\nu_t} dW_t^{\nu}$$ 

This system of SDEs is integrated using numerical methods (only Euler-Maruyama is available for this case yet) in the heston function. 
Then, eu_heston and as_heston use the paths geenerated by the GBM function to price European and Asian options using MC

### Main file 
The main.py file provides an Object Oriented Programming approach to MC option pricing. Options are defined as objects in which the relevant information (value and greeks) can be obtained via class methods


## BinOP folder

The BinOp folder contains code for Binomial model to price European and American Models

### Mathematical background 

### BinOP.py 
The file contains the functions needed for Binomial Option Pricing. Including: 

-
-

### main.py 
The main.py file provides an OOP approach to Binomial option pricing. 
European and American options are defined as objects. From these objects we can then obtain the relevant information (value and greeks), which are defined as class methods based on the functions on the BinOP file 

### examples.ipynb 
A jupyter notebook containing examples on using Binomial method to price several methods 

## BlackScholes folder 

The BlackScholes folder contains code for pricing European options under Black-Scholes model
